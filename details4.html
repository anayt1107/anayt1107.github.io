  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">I modeled this enclosure for a broken Ikea desk lamp, by repurposing its bulb and wiring. Previously, it used a paper-like enclosure to diffuse the light, which took up a lot of desk space, which was a problem, so I made this enclosure as small as possible while still maintaining a well-diffused light output.</p>
