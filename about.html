  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">I am a sophomore at Milpitas High School in California and I am interested in Hardware Engineering. Some of my interests include cars, 3D art & design, and technology.  In my free time, I like to create small projects involving 3D Modeling and Printing, and I made this website to showcase these projects along with their related information and purpose. For my 13th birthday, I got a 3D printer, specifically a Creality Ender 3, which I have modified extensively with 3D printed and other bought parts. I often use it for 3D printing and laser engraving parts. </p>
