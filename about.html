<body style="font-family: Helvetica; margin: 20px;">

  <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">I am a sophmore at Milpitas High School in California and I am intereted in Hardware Engineering. In my free time, I like to create projects involving 3D Modeling and Printing. For my 13th birthday, I got a 3D printer, specifically a Creality Ender 3, which I have modified quite extensively with 3D printed and other bought parts. I still use it to this day for printing and also laser engraving. </p>
